# DeepLearning_CatRecognition
Step by Step implementation of Deep Learning on Cat data set- Andrew Ng Deep Learning Course

This excersie is using the data and course material of Neural Network and Deep Learning course run by Andrew Ng on coursera

I have re- created all the functions in step by step excersise on the Cat image recognition data file- I wanted to see how each function actually works on a reall data file- as step by step implementation was only using the pre created use cases.
this helped me alot to understand how each function actually work and what are the exact shape and dimensions after each step!
